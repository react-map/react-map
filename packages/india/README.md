## Disclaimer 
1) I did not intend to take sides in disputed territories. So, I have tried my best to include both sides of such territories so that the user is free to choose the map they are comfortable in. 
2) If you are facing problems in using any component, such that map is not displaying completely.. Feel free to post an issue and I would get it corrected. It most probably would be an SVG Viewport issue.
